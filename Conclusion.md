# Conclusion

{:start="56"}

56. Before I end, I apologise for having used real examples. I felt that doing so was
necessary to illustrate my points more clearly. In staff work as in other parts
of our jobs, we learn best from mistakes. By pointing out to you the errors
that others have made, you would understand the expectations better. It is not
difficult to be a reasonably good staff officer. You just need to be thorough in
your analyses, keep the big picture in mind, write your ideas in simple and tight
English, go through the forums and timelines for approval, and supervise the
implementation of your ideas. None of this is beyond you but it does require
intellectual rigour, discipline and conscientiousness on your part. You must
demand from yourself and your colleagues high standards. Don’t pass the
buck to somebody else. This is no different from what I have always been
urging our personnel to do in operations – to demand high standards and not
let yourself or anyone else be sloppy. This note is not a proper all-rounded
teaching tool but I hope that staff officers would find it useful.

### _Acknowledgement_
<em>
While the observations and thoughts which constitute the contents of this essay
were mine, it was possible to put them into a coherent whole mainly because my
staff assistant, MAJ Stanley Chua Hon Kiat, had dutifully noted these thoughts and
observations over a period of several years. And it was Stanley who strung these
thoughts together in a fi rst draft of this essay, although we have done so much more
work to the initial draft to the extent that Stanley and I have forgotten how many
drafts we have in fact written. I would therefore like to acknowledge the depth of
contribution by Stanley to this essay.
