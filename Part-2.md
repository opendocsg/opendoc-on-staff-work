# Part 2: “Recommending Plans” – Presenting the Contents of Staff Work

{:start="22"}

With sufficient ambition, conviction and depth in your thoughts, the next step
is to transfer your ideas to another mind. The main medium is through the
written word. MINDEF has standard writing instructions to help the staff officer.
The 4-page rule forces you to be disciplined and to stick to key issues. The
standardised headings of _Introduction_, _Aim_, _Principal Considerations_ and
_Recommendations_ impose a consistent structure to facilitate writing and
reading. But it is not enough just to follow these rules. The ability to convince
people of your proposal also depends on how clearly your arguments flow, how
you pen your thoughts and how you seek approval for your ideas. Incidentally,
I recently read a book titled “Life’s a Pitch: How to Sell Yourself and Your
Brilliant Ideas” co-authored by Stephen Bayley and Roger Mavity. It makes
similar points and reinforces what I will say in this section.

## 2.1 Having a sense of advocacy and a logical flow of arguments

{:start="23"}

23. One of the most important points a staff officer needs to do before he writes
a paper is to decide what is the question he is answering and what is the
solution he intends to recommend. Staff officers sometimes make the mistake
of writing down everything they know without being clear on the points they
really need to convey. Such papers lack a sense of advocacy. A sense of
advocacy means that you keep in mind why you are writing the paper, what is
the position and recommendation you are pushing for, and using these as the
destination, working backwards to see which points or arguments are relevant
and which are not. Only the relevant ones go into the main paper so that
people understand the issue without being mired in needless details.

24. In briefings and presentations, I have often told staff officers to be clear about
what they want the audience to walk away with. The staff officer should ask:
“what are the messages I want the reader or audience to take away?” With
that in mind, write your paper or present your brief always arguing and leading
the reader or audience to that message. Everything in a paper should lead
the reader towards the conclusion and recommendations you have in mind,
with each paragraph edging his views closer to the conclusion you want him
to reach. Papers and briefings must not just be a haphazard series of points
digressing or leading nowhere in particular. Too often, staff officers start to
write, and end, papers without ever consciously imagining what readers would
make of their paper.

25. Related to a sense of advocacy is the need for a logical flow. Write systematically
and logically, building progressively on what has been said before. Too many
staff papers are choppy in the flow of their arguments. A good flow starts with
the title. An inaccurate title misleads the reader and makes it more difficult to
absorb the arguments that follow, not to mention that it destroys the credibility
of the paper. A recent paper titled “F15SG local basing plan” turned out not
to be about basing at all, but dealt with the number of squadrons our F15SGs
should be divided into and the number of aircraft in each squadron. Another
paper promised a “review” of an operating concept, which connoted that there
was an existing concept in practice, but it turned out to be a “proposed” new
concept to be implemented.

26. The titles of the sections within a paper similarly prepare the reader on what
to expect. But very often, the contents in a section fail to deal with what the
title suggests. Here, I want to focus on what the Principal Considerations (PC)
in a paper should be. There are three very common errors. First, the PCs are
often mistaken to be the impetus for doing what the paper wants. But the
PCs are in fact the factors to govern the “how”, whereas the impetus governs
the “why”. For example, the reason _why_ we need the Participation Command
or the impetus for setting up the Participation Command is to increase the
effectiveness of the RSAF’s contribution to land operations. The PCs are then
the factors to be considered when deciding _how_ to design the Participation
Command to achieve the reason for _why_ the Command was set up. The PCs
would therefore include considerations such as “the degree of integration with
the Army”, “a good balance of focus on the task and type competence of airland 
operations”, and “the degree of integration of different units in the RSAF
which participate in the land campaign.” Second, the pros and cons of each 
option suggested in the paper must be explicitly related back to the PCs to see
which option measures up better. But many papers make no reference back
to the PCs in the rest of the paper. This is not unlike your financial consultant
suggesting to you different investment tools without referring to your risk
profi le, desired diversifi cation, or the correlation between the different tools.
You would be right to think that your consultant does not understand what he
should be doing. Third, the PCs in staff papers are sometimes not well thought
through and the clinching factor in favour of an option does not feature in
the list of PCs presented. For instance, there was a paper that proposed the
frequency in which senior RSAF officers need to fl y. The PCs included the
need for senior officers to maintain command presence and to continue to be
exposed to fl ying in order to carry out their jobs better. However, the paper did
not include a PC on the ability of the squadrons to support the increased fl ight
taskings. This last factor turned out to be one of the key issues of contention
during the meeting.

27. The flow of an argument may also be disrupted if critical information is not
presented. In the case of staff papers proposing a new entity or capability,
a common omission is the concept of operations that would govern the
employment of the new capability. The CONOPS explains how a proposed
entity would be employed in conjunction with other weapons and systems in
the RSAF’s orbat. For example, when the papers that addressed the microstructures 
and estabs of the Operational Commands were tabled in 2006,
several did not explain the CONOPS of the Commands. In the absence of a
CONOPS that indicated how the Command would work with other agencies,
there was no basis for the approval forums to decide whether the proposed
structure and distribution of estabs within the Command was sound.

28. Another way to improve the flow of a paper is to present the arguments in
each paragraph coherently. Make arguments, not assertions. Arguments
are properly explained and supported with examples or evidence, whereas
assertions are unsubstantiated statements. Some time back, a paper that
proposed an information management plan for a new capability stated the 
need to limit information release without explaining further. It was not easy
to discuss whether the information should or should not be limited because
there was no argument on what basis the information should be limited. For
instance, it was possible for someone to point to the need to release selected
information for the purposes of deterrence. The paper should thus have argued
that restriction of information was necessary for OPSEC, but at the same
time to acknowledge the need for it to be balanced against the release of
information for deterrence purposes. In crafting an argument, the main point
should appear as the first sentence, not concealed in the middle or end of the
paragraph. A trained reader absorbs information in a paragraph in the context
of its opening line. For new staff officers, a simple paragraph structure for an
argument is this: the first sentence makes the point; the second sentence
elaborates on the point; the third sentence provides an illustration or evidence;
and the fourth sentence relates the point back to the issue tackled in the paper.
This generalises things but for starters it may be a useful heuristic.

29. Finally, all arguments must lead to recommendations. The minimum deliverable
for any paper, staff note or presentation is that it must contain suggestions on
how to proceed. The staff officer must always include recommendations on
the concrete follow-up work on the issues raised. I have often come across
exercise and trip reports that consist of only observations. Such papers are
useful for information but they will not result in much progress. An organisation
or society that conscientiously makes it a point each time to identify a few
concrete items to follow up, compared to one that does not, will make faster
and more progress over time.

## 2.2 Using clear, concise and correct language

{:start="30"}

30. Beyond the thoughts, the flow, the sections and the paragraphs of a paper is the
use of language. A few months ago, I received an email titled “Chinook Rescue
of Merchant Ship”. The Chinook of course rescued some personnel from the
ship – but not the ship. The problem of language is not confined to the RSAF.
In 2007, a reputed international aviation magazine _Aviation Week_ reported that 
“The Republic of Singapore Air Force has deployed a fi fth KC135 to support
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. RSAF has also sent C130 transports to the
Persian Gulf region”. Someone not familiar with the RSAF would have thought
that we had deployed 5 KC135s and a few C130s to the Gulf all at the same
time. What actually happened was that it was the fi fth time the RSAF had sent
a KC135 to the Gulf, and that we had also sent one C130 there previously. In
this case, the poor language favoured us by giving the impression that we had
a much bigger presence than we actually did.

31. The use of words, and the choice and arrangement of words in accordance
with the rules of grammar, are key to conveying ideas from one mind to
another. But I have encountered many instances of wrong English, poor English
or the loose use of English. For example, the correct way is to say that “It is
_recommended that_ the meeting approve…”. But in a recent meeting, there
was a slide that read “The meeting _is recommended to approve_…”. There
are also papers with grammatical errors, such as “It is recommended that the
meeting approves…”. Yet another common mistake is to say that “Minister
has approved _for_ the Black Knights to deploy….”. The correct sentence should
be “Minister has approved _that_ the Black Knights deploy…”.

32. I will highlight a few more common mistakes to reiterate the point. Some
are grammatical errors, some are spelling errors, and others are examples
of the wrong use of words. “This paper aims to inform you _of_”, not “inform
you _on_”. After reading this note, I believe “you _are likely_ to get better” at staff
work rather than “you _would likely be_ getting better” at staff work. You can
choose to “apprise” me of your feedback, which is not the same as choosing to
“appraise” me. I expect my senior officers to “oversee” staff work, not “overlook”
them. You are “responsible _for achieving_ standards”, not “responsible _to achieve_ 
standards”. Earlier, I talked about “princip*al*” considerations and not
“princip*le*” considerations. A staff officer knows that a “*dead*line” is different
from a “*date*line”. “I _could_ reward you for good staff work” conveys a different
meaning from “I _would_ reward you”, “I _might_ reward you” or “I _should_ reward
you”. “The staff officer is responsible for writing clearly” is used in a different 
way from “_A staff officer_ is responsible for writing clearly”, which is used
differently from “Staff officers are responsible for writing clearly”. It is “_the_
RSAF” and not “RSAF” that is keen to improve the standards of staff work and
I am “_the_ Chief of Air Force” and not “Chief of Air Force”. I will leave it to you
to clarify if you did not understand any of these examples.

33. Something that puts a reader off immediately are grammatical and typographical
errors. A report that came to me for final vetting prior to being distributed to
the MINDEF leadership had a sentence that read “the increased exposure of
our officers _have_ strengthened _our their_ confidence in the RSAF”. In this short
sentence, there is a grammatical and a typographical error. There were also
errors strewn all over the paper. Such mistakes reflect a lack of discipline and
conscientiousness. If the staff officer does not find it important to do these
basics properly, do not expect the reader to take what you write seriously either.
One of the best ways to avoid errors like these is to have your paper proofread 
by an untainted mind, someone who has not seen it before. A staff officer
should not pass such mistakes to his branch head to correct, a branch head
should not pass them to his department head to correct, and a department
head should definitely set high standards for his department and arrest the
mistakes. Yet, I often find careless errors. Recently, there was a paper which
would have been distributed to the MINDEF leadership if I had not stopped
it. Within a paragraph, this paper had sentences such as “to experiment
operating concepts…” rather than “to experiment _with_ operating concepts...”;
“to validate CONOPs of…” rather than “to validate _the_ CONOPS of…”; and “to
refine concept of…” rather than “to refine _the_ concept of…”.

34. Quite apart from the wrong use of English is the poor use of English. Good
writing does not mean using big words to impress the reader. It means using
simple, clear and concise words. For instance, use the word “aware” if you
are not sure how it is different from “cognisant”. Use the term “based on”
which is easier on the mind than “premised upon”. The sentence “A total of
81 servicemen were diagnosed with Dengue fever across the SAF in 2007” is
not grammatically wrong, but it can be re-written as “81 SAF servicemen were
diagnosed with Dengue fever in 2007” to form a sentence structure that is 
easier to read. Convey your message using the least number of words, so that
every word has a unique and necessary contribution to the sentence. There
was a paper with this sentence: “Most of the media coverage on the RSAF from
January to March 2008 were _largely_ intended”. Nothing is lost if we remove
the word “largely” since the word “most” is already in the sentence. Another
paper wrote “The RSAF is _currently_ embarking on its transformation into the 3rd
Generation Air Force”. Again, nothing is lost by omitting the word “currently”.
In the sentence “we should _place more focus_ on people development”, the
writer could have said “we should _focus more on_ people development”. If you
scrutinise the need for every word in your paper, you may be able to fulfi l
the 4-page rule without resorting to 0.5-inch page margins or 6-point font
spacings between paragraphs.

35. Next, the loose use of English. This is a trend we need to arrest because it
reflects sloppy thinking. I don’t like the “/” because it often means that the
writer is not sure what he is referring to. There was a sentence in a paper
that said “The approval for a deviation from these guidelines will be sought
from CAF/COS(AS)/HAO”. I asked who exactly the approval authority was, and
got no clear answer. Similarly, do not use phrases like “and so on” or “etc”,
because it means you have a vague idea but you are not sure. Last year, when
I was signing congratulatory letters for officers awarded National Day medals,
I noticed that the letters read “Your many years of commitment and dedication
to your work and the organisation have undoubtedly contributed to ensuring
that the RSAF remains true to its vision of being a ‘World Class People, First
Class Air Force’”. The word “undoubtedly” suggested that the writer was not
certain what the officer had done but believed he must surely have contributed.
Also avoid overly definitive words like “impossible” or “undoubtedly”. They
invoke the same skepticism in the reader as when you say something will
be “forever”. In addition, scrutinise the meanings of the words and phrases
used. Some words have overlapping meanings but they are not the same. A
common error is the use of “similar” and “identical” interchangeably. There
was also a paper that used “concept development”, “system development”
and “capability development” synonymously, but the three terms in fact mean
different things. 

36. It is important to demand high standards in our language. In 1979, Minister
Mentor, then-Prime Minister, had gathered the top brass of the government
and the civil service to talk about the importance of writing clearly and
concisely. You may also have heard our Prime Minister and other Ministers
in their speeches say that one of the main reasons Singapore has succeeded
internationally is that English is the language of science and commerce. Our
unique proposition for many years was that we were one of the few colonial
countries who embraced English instead of turning against it during the 1950s,
60s and 70s. This gave us a huge head-start. But if we allow our standard of
English to slip, we could one day lose one of our main economic advantages.

## 2.3 Using numbers, graphics and verbal presentations effectively

{:start="37"}

37. Besides the flow of arguments and the use of language, let me share two
further ways to present staff papers more clearly. First, make effective use of
numbers, charts, tables, diagrams and pictures. They summarise chunks of
data into easily readable forms. But numbers in themselves are meaningless. It
is only when analysed against longer-term trends, contexts and denominators
that their signifi cance is apparent. This is something many staff papers fail
to do well. For example, you can report the recruitment figures this year but
it means nothing until you compare them against the statistics from the past
years, explain what the figures mean relative to recruitment targets, analyse
the ramifi cations for the RSAF’s future manning, and recommend actions
needed based on those figures.

38. Moreover, not only do many papers fail to present statistics in a helpful way,
they also do not present the figures in a way that is obvious how one number
leads to the next or to the conclusion. The reader consequently has to do
extreme mental acrobatics or to struggle to make sense of the conclusion. A
paper that compared the annual safety performance of two air forces – the
YAF and the ZAF – reported that the mishap rate was 0.947 for YAF fighters
and 1.795 for YAF transport aircraft, compared to 0.828 for ZAF fighters and 
1.044 for ZAF transport aircraft. A footnote added that the YAF fl ew 6,506,650
fighter hours and 8,936,820 transport hours, while the ZAF fl ew 241,624
fighter hours and 95,775 transport hours. The paragraph then concluded that
the ZAF’s performance was therefore _comparable_ to the YAF’s. No matter how
I multiplied, divided or subtracted those figures, the ZAF’s statistics were still
superior, and I could not understand how the conclusion was reached.

39. Second, the use of the spoken word. When done well, the spoken word is
stronger, more emotive and commands attention. But let me set the record
straight on the use of presentations. For important issues such as operational
planning, I discourage the practice of depending solely on briefings and
powerpoint slides. Powerpoint slides are inadequate in explaining the deep
rationale behind the actions planned. When a staff officer hands over his job,
the successor is highly unlikely to understand the rationale for the thoughts
just from the slides, unlike if there was a paper that explains the plans or the
processes of planning.

40. But presentations can complement a paper if they are done well. I have
some pointers. First, know the rules of the meeting. I don’t encourage slide
presentations in the meetings I chair unless you have something to add
beyond what is in your paper. But in some meetings, slides are compulsory as
a preamble to the discussion. If unsure, check with the meeting’s Secretary.
Second, learn how to use the staff aids such as the projectors, video equipment
and lighting in the room. The inability to operate a projector or the lighting
has often led to interruptions or awkward silences. Third, be sensitive to the
body language of the listeners. You may have planned a list of things to say
but speed up if people are getting restless. Fourth, be sensitive to your own
habits. Some people tend to intersperse their speech with “so-called”, “ok” or
“alright”, which can be grating on the listener’s ears, not to mention that 
“so-called” is a risky adjective to use carelessly because you may end up saying
“the so-called Chief of Air Force Ng Chee Khern” by which you mean that I am
not really the Chief of Air Force in your opinion. Fifth, the correct way is to write
in codewords, but speak in clear. Sixth, although speaking in a near-scripted 
way is acceptable for an inexperienced briefer, you should build up confidence
to speak off-the-cuff so that you can convey the right tones and stress the right
points. Seventh, when taking questions, let people finish before you answer.
Members of meetings are senior enough to know what they are asking. They
don’t like to be interrupted with an answer they are not looking for and have
to repeat their question. Finally, listen carefully to the question. Know why the
question was asked and understand the concern that prompted it. One of the
main ways in which a person reveals his abilities is the extent to which he can
answer a question to the point and how well he can engage in a discussion.
And rather than waffl e, talk about something else you are more familiar with,
or repeat what is already in the paper, just answer the question.

## 2.4 Getting the staff processes right

{:start="41"}

41. Apart from the contents, the processes of staff work are equally crucial. These
are the steps beyond the thinking and the writing to get your ideas approved.
In April last year, a draft Squadron Commander’s handbook was promulgated
before I had even seen it, even though it was intended to be a RSAF document.
Last July, the RSAF _40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary_ book was submitted to me through the
staff channel without discussion at any forum. Both documents should have
been properly tabled for discussion at a RSAF-level forum because they dealt
with RSAF-level issues. The _40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary_ book was to be sold to the public
and even greater care should have been taken to ensure that the relevant
forums were given the chance to comment on it.

42. The distinction between “endorsement” and “approval” is often not well
understood. There was a draft paper that sought the MINDEF leadership’s
_endorsement_ for a proposed concept. Endorse means “to say publicly that you
support a person, statement or course of action”, whereas approve means
“to officially agree to a plan, request”. By asking the MINDEF leadership to
“endorse”, you are saying that it does not have the authority to approve the
paper. But the MINDEF leadership is the highest authority in the ministry and
hence they cannot be endorsing for a yet higher agency to approve. In another 
instance, a staff note prepared to answer a query from Minister was planned
to go through CAF, PS(DD), PS(D) and then Minister. I tried very hard to see
why the staff officer routed it as such but could not figure it out. If the intent
was to go through all my superiors, it should have gone through CDF too. The
note was eventually amended to go to Minister through CAF, and copied to the
rest.

43. Some things are more urgent than others. Operational matters and breaking
news involving the media and the public are generally more time-sensitive.
When such issues are brewing, the staff officer must be quick to keep their
bosses informed and “armed.” Otherwise, your bosses would be surprised by
their bosses or ambushed by the public on an issue they should know but they
do not, because you have not informed them in time.

44. One trend that has become increasingly prominent in recent years is the
creation of joint task forces and matrix structures, and the consequent need
for multiple reporting. Multiple reporting involve staff processes that are not
as straightforward as the traditional single-reporting line. For example, in the
deployment of our Super Pumas with the Landing Ship Tank to the Gulf of Aden,
both the RSN and the RSAF are involved. Some decisions will need to be taken
by the RSN leadership, and some by the RSAF. Staff officers must understand
what to surface to the different agencies for approval or information. Where
inputs are required at the staff level, they must be properly endorsed by the
correct agency first before they are submitted formally. This is not meant to
add to the bureaucracy, but to ensure that people with the right expertise and
experience lend their collective wisdom to the issue at hand.

45. When tabling papers through different forums, don’t prepare a one-size-
fits-all paper. Every forum is interested in a different aspect of the issue and
each forum consists of people with different backgrounds. While it is the
responsibility of the Air Force leadership to scrutinise the tactical and technical
details of a proposal, it is the responsibility of the MINDEF leadership to
scrutinise the strategic and political implications of a proposal. Hence, the 
way a paper is written should reflect the different concerns of the forums to
which the paper is tabled. Refine your paper and provide more or less details
as necessary. In addition, write your paper for a generalist, not a specialist.
Someone who knows nothing of the topic must still be able to understand
your arguments. Last year, a draft paper that proposed a revised approach for
outsourcing the maintenance of RSAF aircraft referred to “the Onion and Pizza
models”, without clearly explaining what the two models were. These models
may be known to the logistics community, but not to the rest of the RSAF,
let alone to the MINDEF leadership. The paper was revised to include a brief
explanation of the Onion and Pizza models in the Introduction. Another draft
paper used the acronyms FSC and AMT without explaining them in full. While
people in the RSAF know that they stand for Flight Simulator Centre and Air
Mission Trainer respectively, members of the MINDEF leadership may not. If
you want the forum to understand your paper to improve the chances of having
it approved or endorsed, write in a way that the members of the meeting can
easily understand. A useful guide is to write your paper for an intelligent but
uninformed reader.

46. One measure that I advocate although it is not an institutionalised process is to
strategise and position an issue so that it has a higher chance of success when
tabled to higher forums. Before you surface an important issue for approval, it
would be best if you can find ways to sense the opinion of the decision-makers.
If the decision-makers are hearing your recommendation for the first time, you
are getting into a high-risk game of the proposal being rejected. The SAF goes
through a process of pre-operation planning before going into battle to ensure
that we are well-prepared. Similarly, when treating a signifi cant issue, consider
briefing the Chairman of the meeting beforehand to seek some views first.
Alternatively, you may wish to use other related papers to bring up the point –
what some of us call “floating a balloon” – to sound out an issue and obtain a
sensing of the opinions first. Without an idea of your bosses’ views in a general
way or where they stand on an issue, you run a great risk of a proposal being
completely thrown out. 

47. But this does not mean that you should be a “yes-man” or second-guess what
your bosses think. As I explained earlier, it is paramount for you to first be
convinced about your ideas before you surface a proposal. This is a balance
you need to strike. One of the most important things for a staff officer is to
know how and when to take directions. Listen to what your superior has to say,
rather than be overly eager to tell him what you are thinking regardless of what
he is saying. If after evaluating what he has said, you believe you have a better
suggestion, raise it. But listen first. Some staff officers do well because they
are very intelligent. Some staff officers may not be as intelligent but they still
do well because they listen to and carry out their bosses’ intent in a way that
earns their bosses’ trust, comfort and confidence.

48. This brings me to another point – the need for minutes. Whether it is a briefing,
informal discussion, ground visit or a Q&A session at seminars, notes of
discussions should be taken as long as the senior MINDEF or SAF leadership is
involved. The spoken word is perishable and memories become vague quickly.
A culture which depends only on oral transmission is a relatively primitive
culture. Only when a culture is able to transmit through the written word does it
become a civilisation. Minutes help people remember what was said and give
credibility when reference is made to the views expressed. Minutes also help
to inform those who were not at the session – including future generations
of staff officers – of the discussions that took place. Well-taken notes are
therefore crucial. BG(NS) Bernard Tan has written a useful guide on minute 
taking when he was the Chief Armour officer some years back. I would just
add one more point to his guide. In general, the higher up the hierarchy, the
less the note-taker can take the liberty to fi lter or paraphrase the discussions.
Senior MINDEF and SAF officials choose words carefully to convey a specifi c
point and the subtle nuances, and minutes should take what these members
say in verbatim. Perhaps at lower forums or sessions that involve less senior
officers, more discretion is allowed. 

49. Finally, plan a reasonable timeline to submit your paper. This appears to be
common sense but it is alarming how frequently it is not done. Different forums
have different rules. I ask for meeting papers to be distributed 4 days prior so
that I have time to read the papers. Deadlines are set for papers to be distributed
so that the Chairman and members have enough time to read and think about
the issue, do justice to your work, provide value-added comments and make
sound decisions. Forecast all the forums that your paper has to go through
and cater time for meeting schedules, amendments, and the movements of
key personnel. If the paper has to be tabled to the MINDEF leadership, the staff
officer should work out a reasonable schedule that would allow the paper to
incorporate comments from the meetings chaired by PS(D), CDF and CAF prior.
One thing that bosses do not appreciate is to be given fait accompli. There is
no point in tabling a paper, only to tell the Chairman that his comments cannot
be incorporated because you have run out of time to make changes. If yours
is a substantial paper, submit in chapters and not at one go. A 200-page
book was submitted to me for vetting in July 2008. It was an excellent book
but as the entire book was submitted to me all at once three weeks before it
went for print, I could only ask for changes at the margins, when in fact, I had
preferred a quite different framework to organise the contents in the book. If
it is a speech you are preparing, submit the draft well in advance because the
speaker would have his own points to add.

50. Having said so much about how to submit papers and issues, I must say
that we should also be discerning about what papers and issues we in fact
surface up. officers sometimes feel they are micro-managed or not sufficiently
empowered. If so, you should not invite others to micro-manage you if a
decision is within your pay-grade to make. By referring decisions you could
have made to your bosses to approve, you are inviting your bosses to micromanage you. 
Many of us say tongue-in-cheek that a decision is above our pay
grade. But I also often say that a decision is below my pay grade because it
should be taken by levels below me.
