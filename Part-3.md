# PART 3: “Translating Decisions, Supervising Execution” – Implementing the Contents of Staff Work

{:start="51"}

51. Many staff officers think that their job ends when a paper is approved. This
would be like me saying that my job is completed the moment the vision of the
3rd Generation RSAF was approved. In my Workplan speech in 2008, I focused
on the importance of _managing_ transformation. I said that “what distinguishes
a truly successful organisation is not how sharp or visionary its ideas are, but
how rigorously its people are able to confront the difficulties and implement
those ideas.” We can have the best policies on paper, but they would not
translate to useful outcomes unless followed through and implemented. A
culture with proper _follow through_ distinguishes us from many other countries
and gives us an immeasurable advantage. When we promise to do something,
we deliver. This is one of the key lessons of Singapore’s history of success.

52. Two deeply-entrenched cultural factors help us ensure rigorous follow-through
in the implementation of our ideas and policies. First, we have a strong
organisational culture and our people know that the organisation expects us to
deliver on our promises. Second, our people have the discipline as individuals
to live up to the organisation’s expectations. This has been witnessed time
after time when we organise and successfully pull off major events such as
the Global Air Power Conference and the annual National Day Parades. We
must not allow either the organisational culture or the individual discipline to
weaken.

53. But this is not enough. The translation of policies to outcomes can still be
tenuous and haphazard in the longer term if we do not understand the role
of the staff in enforcing and supervising the execution of plans and policies.
In the last cycle of Workplan presentations by the Operational Commands to
the Chief of Air Force, I noticed that the HQ RSAF departments made very few
comments on the presentations even after I asked for their views. To ensure
that the Commands execute the plans laid out to them by HQ RSAF, it is the
responsibility of the staff in HQ RSAF to _hold_ the Commands _to account_. There
must be a proper system of checks and balances, and of enforcement and
accountability. It is not enough to rely on _trust_. This is not a matter of whether
the Chief of Air Force trust the Commands to carry out the plans laid out to
them by HQ RSAF. It is about the need for a strong institution of governance,
without which we cannot be sure that the implementation of policies can
remain rigorous over the longer term. Many countries in history have declined
or collapsed because they did not have institutions capable of systematically
and consistently demanding accountability from their sub-units – Gorbachev’s
Soviet Union and the Chinese dynasties in their declining years. And in the
same way that the HQ RSAF departments help the Chief of Air Force enforce
the execution of plans on the Commands, the Ops Development Groups are
the staff to the Operational Commanders to enforce that the squadrons and
battalions implement the plans of the Command.

54. Another aspect of supervising execution is to develop the tools and feedback
loops to ensure a closure to the conceptualisation and implementation of
policies. One example is how the RSAF has implemented our organisational
restructuring since 2006. To have proper accountability over the implementation
of our restructuring, we had a system where interim and full Post-Implementation
Reviews were conducted three months and one year respectively after each
Command was set up.

55. No less august a person as Mahatma Gandhi said: “the measure of success
is not the result but the effort.” Many earnest kind hearted officers would like
to believe this. But unfortunately, I cannot agree with Gandhi. War is a serious
undertaking where failure can mean not just the deaths of family members
or fellow soldiers and countrymen, but also the demise of the country. In
something as grave as war, surely the result must count. And not only must the
result count, the result is arguably the only thing that counts in the case of a
fi ght for survival. That one has tried his best is an excuse that we cannot afford
in war. It is precisely the staff officer who has a crucial role in supervising the
execution and enforcing the outcome. In war, process-success ranks a far
second to outcome-success. The staff officer must concentrate on the ends
more than the means. We must not give in to a culture where just trying hard
is a good enough reason to find an unsuccessful outcome acceptable.
