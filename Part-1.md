# Part 1: “Studying The Situation” – The Contents of Staff Work

{:start="3"}

3. A senior government official in charge of the international affairs of the US Air
Force told me that “Singapore is the most analytical nation I have ever known.”
He meant it as a compliment, that before we make a decision, we dissect the
issue from different angles and ensure that it is not only desirable but feasible.
It is one of our real comparative advantages as a nation and as an airforce that
we are thorough and systematic in analysing and making decisions. But it is
not something we can take for granted. It is something that we have achieved
because we have staff officers who form the collective thinkers and the brains
of the organisation, and who are not just paper writers. So how do we ensure
that we continue to “study the situation” in the best possible way?

## 1.1 Punching above your weight – Have ambition in your thoughts and plans

{:start="4"}

4. First, it is important for staff officers to have ambitions, whether it is in giving
options to your commanders in operational plans to fight a war or in force plans
to develop the force structure. Singapore has been credited with being able to
“punch above its weight”. This could easily be a cliché, but it should not be.
We have to constantly seek and create opportunities to make a difference, to
improve the organisation, or to better profile ourselves to increase the public’s
confidence in us and our ability to deter potential aggressors.

5. Many staff officers feel they are unimportant digits in the organisation since
they are low in the hierarchy. This cannot be further from the truth. The 
first-cut recommendations for many issues come from the staff, not always the
commander. Even if the proposals are fine-tuned in the process, the core
recommendations often persist. The proposals for the microstructures and the
detailed estab distribution within the new Operational Commands came mainly
from the staff officers of the Commands. The Public-Private Partnership model,
which is a significant component of our training transformation, was adopted
by the RSAF largely on the suggestion of staff officers in the Air Training
Department. The Black Knights interstitials that most of you may have seen on 
national television in the weeks leading up to National Day Parade 2008 was
suggested by the staff of DiTV. These interstitials turned out to be very well
received by the public. All of these ideas were ambitious and originated from
the staff. If nothing, I believe it should be a great reward and satisfaction for
a staff officer to know that your ideas were implemented and that you have
personally played a part in shaping the Air Force for years to come. 

6. Being ambitious applies to all levels of staff officers. When I recommended
that we form a Black Knights Aerobatic Team in 2007, I had in mind that
they would only perform in the inaugural Singapore Airshow 2008. However,
the team manager Colonel Ho Foo Sing suggested that the team could also
perform in the National Day Parade as it was the RSAF’s 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary. The
Black Knights subsequently did that to the acclaim of the nation. It was an
ambitious proposal by Colonel Ho which has done much to increase the RSAF’s
reputation with the public and their confidence in the professionalism and
quality of the airforce. In 2007, I had also suggested that the RSAF organise
a Global Air Power Conference to attract foreign Air Chiefs and senior officers
to Singapore, so that their presence would serve to support the inaugural
Singapore Airshow. It was an ambitious idea and we were not sure that we
could pull it off convincingly. But in the end, 27 Air Chiefs attended our Global
Air Power Conference. This significantly profiled the soft power of the RSAF,
especially when the participants observed how well we planned and executed
the Conference, the Airshow, and our Black Knights’ performances. 

7. One important prerequisite of being ambitious is that you must be truly
convinced of your proposal. Uphold your integrity and don’t put up proposals
simply because you think it is what your bosses want. In all of the above
examples, the people who surfaced the ideas did so after they had gone
through the honest due process of evaluating whether the idea was sound
and feasible. You must be convinced that yours is the right proposal for the
organisation and not because you have second-guessed that it is what your
bosses want.

## 1.2 Analysing the issue deeply

{:start="8"}

8. An ambitious idea must also be grounded in reality. The only way we can
ensure that an ambitious plan is feasible is by thoroughly analysing the issue.
Many staff officers make the mistake of just presenting facts, or just describing
a situation rather than analysing it. You are expected to analyse the facts, say
what you think about the issue, present solutions and explain the reasons
for your recommendations. Begin your analysis by reading old papers on the
same issue because they tell you the background, the past concerns and
what aspects of the situation are different so that you can argue your case
more convincingly. (But when you read the old papers, read the minutes of the
forum to which the paper was tabled. Some recommendations may have been
rejected, and even those recommendations approved as a whole could have
been modifi ed because some parts were disagreed with. You would only know
all this from the minutes. This is why when submitting an old paper, always
attach the minutes, because the paper alone does not in fact tell you the final
decision made.)

9. Analyses can be done at different levels of depth. In a meeting I chaired in
2006, two Post-Implementation Review papers of contrasting quality were
tabled on separate C4 systems. If you were asked what difference a new
C4 system has made, it would not be enough to say that it has made our
C2 infrastructure more robust. But that was exactly where the first paper
stopped its analysis. The second paper was better. It explained that the C2
infrastructure was more robust because there were more redundancies, the
control hierarchy was fl atter, information was disseminated more quickly and
decision-making became faster after the system was implemented. When we
analyse something, we must be clear _what difference_ it has brought with it. For
those with children, it is akin to asking your children why they like chicken rice
and they tell you “because it is nice”. That does not help one understand the
issue more deeply. A better answer would surely be “because it is more fragrant
than normal steamed rice”. Similarly, if one were asked why Shakespeare is
a good writer, a barely satisfactory answer would be “because he is deep”. A 
more meaningful reply that would provide a deeper understanding of the issue
would be to say that “he reaches into the heart of human emotions, and he is
able to express love and hate in very convincing ways”.

10. Let me illustrate further what I mean by analysing an issue deeply. When writing
any paper, you must ask questions such as: is the situation unfolding according
to plan? What are the ends to achieve and which are the means? Are we
achieving the ends better or just the means? What is the hierarchy of issues,
which are critical and which are secondary? If the situation is not happening
according to plan, is it because the plan is inadequate or the execution has
been poor? Is the execution hampered by factors within or beyond our control?
Is what is being done sufficient or do we need to do more? Should we do more
of the same or more of something else? These questions are not exhaustive
but they illustrate how you should dissect and probe each answer further to
achieve depth in your analyses. The point is not just to describe facts, but to
analyse and assess them.


## 1.3 Distinguishing between first and second-order thinking – Ends and means; doing the right things and doing things right

{:start="11"}

11. This distinction between the ends and the means is an important one and it leads
me to another way to enhance the depth of analysis – to understand the difference
between what I refer to as first- and second-order thinking. First-order thinking
asks questions such as “why do I want to do something?”; second-order thinking
asks questions such as “how do I do it ?” First-order questions use “why” as the
operative word; second-order questions use “how” as the operative word. First-order 
thinking asks “are we doing the _right things_?”; second-order thinking asks “are 
we doing _things right_?” First-order thinking focuses on the ends; second-order 
thinking focuses on the means. First-order thinking tells you whether you _should_ 
do something; second-order thinking tells you whether you _can_ do it. First-order
ideas lead to improvements of a transformational nature; second-order ideas lead 
to improvements of an incremental or evolutionary nature. 

12. Staff officers tend to engage in second-order thinking and not enough in
first-order thinking. A draft paper on the Post Implementation Review of the
Participation Command last year described at great length what the Participation
Command has done since it was inaugurated and what it intended to do in the
following year. It struck me that the paper sounded like a Workplan paper
rather than a Post Implementation Review. To the extent that it went beyond
description, the paper assessed whether the Participation Command had
improved our cross-domain integration with the Army. It noted that there was
more frequent contact between different elements of the Army and the RSAF,
and that air-land exercises were planned more collaboratively. But it did not
sufficiently assess whether the Participation Command had in fact achieved
the fundamental objective it was set up to do – to increase the effectiveness
of the RSAF’s contributions to land operations. More cross-domain integration
between the Army and the RSAF should presumably lead to more effective air
operations in the land campaign but this would be to mistake the means for
the ends. It would be necessary to directly assess the ends too, that is, whether
the Command had in fact enhanced the RSAF’s ability to make a difference to
the Army’s effectiveness in the land campaign.

13. The tendency to think at the second-level and not enough at the first is evident
not only in staff papers but also in other aspects of our daily work. A pilot who
was interviewed to be a Commanding officer in the Air Combat Command
said that he would build up his unit’s air-land and air-sea capabilities, but
even after some prompting, he did not see the need to keep the Participation
Command informed. It was only when asked who in the RSAF was in charge
of participation issues that he realised he needed to report to the Participation
Command. Second-order thinking is easier because the parameters are
clearer and in most instances clearly laid out. First-order thinking is difficult
because it takes greater leaps of imagination to arrive at feasible solutions.
It also requires moral courage to challenge the status quo, the deep-seated
assumptions and the established ways of doing things. 

14. The relative weight placed on first- and second-order questions depends on
the issue at hand. On the one hand, first-order thinking is more relevant higher
in the organisational hierarchy, for more policy-oriented papers, and during
uncertain or developmental times. First-order thinking is particularly crucial in
charting new directions and path-breaking developments. Hence, in 2006, it
was important for the RSAF to ask the first-order question of whether we were
doing the right things a few years after we entered the new millennium. If at
that time the RSAF leadership had stopped at asking the second-order question
of whether we were doing things right, the RSAF would have continued to get
better at air defence and air superiority, but there would not be a fundamental
breakthrough in the way we contribute to the SAF. It was only when we asked
the first-order question of whether we were doing the right things that it
became obvious that the airforce could do a lot more to shape surface and
information operations with the new technologies available. Similarly, it is only
when we think at the first-order of why the RSAF exists that we will understand
our responsibilities in building commitment to defence at the national level,
and appreciate the importance of our roles in national events such as the
National Day Parade. Only then will we understand that our participation in the
National Day Parade is not distracting us from our “primary” duty, because one
of our primary duties broadly understood is to ensure that our people remain
confident in us, and our adversaries are deterred by us, so that we need not
even go to war in the first place.

15. On the other hand, second-order thinking is usually more pertinent to
implementation issues and during periods of consolidation. In the mid 1990s
to the early 2000s, when the RSAF took delivery of many new platforms such
as the Chinooks, F16D+s, KC-135s and the Apaches, it was important to
concentrate on the second-order question of efficiency and whether we were
doing things right. Similarly, today, 3 years after we started our transformation,
it has become necessary for us to re-focus again on making sure we are doing
things right. 

16. However, even second-order implementation papers should be informed by
first-order thinking. Before you can address the details of “how”, you must be
clear about the “why” so that the implementation details are aligned with the
ends and consistent with the assumptions. This is nothing but saying in another
way that before detailed execution, you should understand the “commander’s
intent”. Before 1998, the weekly RSAF leadership meetings involved only the
HQ RSAF Department Heads and not the Commanders. This was because a
school of thought preferred Commanders to be spending as much time on
the ground as possible so that they are seen to be commanding and close
to the pulse of the ground. But there are also great advantages to having
Commanders attend these weekly meetings, especially during a period of great
change and fl ux, such as how we are presently undertaking a fundamental
organisational restructuring. It allows our Commanders, as they set up their
new Commands and do new things, to understand the deeper rationale of what
they are attempting to do. In big countries where geographical distances make
it impossible to tie execution on the ground closely to policy-making at the
centre or the HQ, the OODA loop would not be as quick and tight. The fact that
our policy-making at the HQ level and ground execution by our commanders
can be much tighter due to our being a small country is thus a strength we
must exploit.

17. I believe in sharing information widely because it helps in first-order thinking.
I have done this through a series of CAF’s messages, informal emails, and
big and small group dialogue sessions. The information may not be directly or
immediately relevant, but building up a good feel of what is happening around
your area of work is crucial in understanding the bigger picture to facilitate
first-order thinking. The American system of education is broad-based and
concentrates on breadth rather than depth, and on a spattering of knowledge
across distantly related subjects rather than drilling in on a particular topic.
In contrast, the British system of education specialises deeply and focuses
less on the lateral connections across disciplines. I would venture that the
American system is more conducive to first-order thinking, whereas the British 
system is better for second-order thinking. This is partly why in SAF and RSAF
forums, we have a breadth of expertise across commands and departments.
The knowledge across disciplines and subject matters is what enables us to
understand the “why” and determine the right things to be done.

## 1.4 Optimising at the system level and at the sub-system levels

{:start="18"}

18. Another useful dimension to consider in analysing an issue is the level of the
organisation, or the balance along the generalist-specialist spectrum, at which
we should optimise. When our airforce was set up from scratch, we had to
optimise at the lowest level. That is, we had to concentrate on building up type
and vocational competence. But once we have built up a solid foundation in
type competence, in order for the RSAF to progress, we have to seek greater
task competence. The level of optimisation therefore moves up. On the other
hand, when we first built the SAF, we initially tried to optimise at the level of
the SAF. The air and naval capabilities were only Commands within the SAF
rather than separate Services. But this level of generality was too high for a
new organisation and in 1975 we had to devolve the air and naval components
into separate Services.

19. Optimising at too high a level of generality runs the risk of not having enough 
type and technical competence. Optimising at too low a level of generality ensures
type and technical competence but insufficient task or team competence. A
football analogy is useful. How much should we train an attacker in all the
technical virtuosity of dribbling and shooting and how much should we train him
in a team? The balance is not easy to strike. Brazilian teams have individuals
who are very talented but not always robust enough as a team. German teams
on the other hand often have less world-class individuals but nonetheless
gel strongly as a team and repeatedly do well in international tournaments.
If we strike the right balance, the end result will be a strong team of great
individuals.

20. 2 years ago, the RSAF evaluated the arguments for and against maintaining
our template for Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN). To optimise at the national
level, we should release the TACAN height template over PLAB so that national
development is enhanced as much taller buildings could be built in the Central
Business District and in Marina South. But this must not have a critical adverse
impact at the level of the RSAF by compromising safety. To ensure safety is
not compromised while enhancing national development, the RSAF moved the
TACAN over from PLAB to CAB. We were able to optimise at both the levels
of the country and the RSAF, an infrequent but certainly win-win situation. I
consider this as one of my main achievements as the Chief of Air Force even
though it did not increase the effectiveness of the RSAF. However, there is
often no fi xed answer as to the right level of optimisation. Although optimising
at the higher level was right in this case, there are times when one would need
to optimise at the lower level. The point is that staff officers need to present
and evaluate both perspectives.

21. While it sounds elementary that a staff officer must study the situation and
analyse issues deeply, you will be surprised at how often this is not done well.
Every now and then, I come across meetings that have to spend a long time
trying to decipher the rationale and principles for proposals in a paper instead
of debating whether the proposals were sound. You know that a paper has not
been well written if the analyses take place during the approval forum, when
they should have been explained in the paper. Conversely, there are occasions
when an issue is so well thought through that the forum has nothing to add.
When the Air Force tabled a paper that proposed the creation of the UAV
Command in 2006, it was approved with no comments from Minister or other
members, even though it had widespread and long-term implications on UAV
development across the SAF. This was because the inputs and concerns from
all stakeholders were thoroughly considered and presented, and the forum just
had to decide whether or not to agree with the recommendations.
