# Introduction

1. The RSAF has traditionally focused on training our people to be good operators.
But not enough has been done to prepare our people for staff work. This is
all the more peculiar given that staff colleges started off teaching staff work
and only evolved into staff _and command_ colleges later. We need to properly
teach staff work. And we should start by being clear what a staff officer is. Two
things I would like to highlight. First, although “staff officer” in the technical
sense refers to the junior officers in HQ appointments, I use the term more
generally to refer to anyone who performs a staff function to a higher authority.
A Branch Head is a staff officer to the Department Head, a Department Head
or a Commander is a staff officer to the Chief, and I am a staff officer to the
Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and CDF. This makes all of us a staff officer.

2. Second, most of you have probably not read the official SAF definition of what
being a “staff” officer means. The SAF Dictionary defines it as “an officer
who is specifically ordered or detailed to assist the commander, studies the
situation continually for anticipatory planning, recommends plans and orders
on his own initiative or in response to directives, translates the commander’s
decisions into orders and disseminates them thereof, and supervises their
execution to ensure adherence and successful execution of the intentions and
policies of the commander.” This definition is written more for the operational
planning staff officer than the force planning, force structuring or operational
development staff officer. But if we analyse it carefully, the essence for the
different types of staff officers is all contained in it. First, a staff officer “studies
the situation”; second, he “_recommends plans_”; and third, he “_translates the
commander’s decisions… and supervises their execution to ensure adherence
and successful execution..._”.
